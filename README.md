## SMS Spam Classification

This project, completed under the Bharat Internship program in 2024, aimed to develop a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam (ham). It leverages a public SMS spam dataset from Kaggle and employs robust text preprocessing techniques for optimal model performance.

### Data Acquisition

The project utilized a publicly available SMS spam dataset from Kaggle ([Link to Kaggle dataset if available]). This rich dataset provided a diverse range of messages for model training and evaluation.

### Data Preprocessing

The raw SMS data underwent rigorous preprocessing steps to enhance the quality of the data and prepare it for machine learning:

1. **Tokenization:** Messages were segmented into individual words, breaking down sentences into a sequence of tokens.
2. **Stop Word Removal:** Common words with minimal semantic meaning (e.g., "the", "a", "is") were eliminated, reducing noise and focusing the model on more relevant terms.
3. **Lemmatization:** Words were transformed into their base forms (e.g., "running" -> "run"), ensuring consistency and improving model generalizability.
4. **Vectorization:** The preprocessed text data was converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization. This technique considers the importance of words within the dataset, weighting them based on their frequency in the entire corpus and individual messages.

These preprocessing steps laid the foundation for effective model training and accurate spam classification.

### Model Training and Evaluation

Several machine learning models were evaluated for spam classification. Among these, Support Vector Machine (SVC) emerged as the most effective model, achieving the highest accuracy. The training process involved:

1. **Data Splitting:** The dataset was meticulously divided into training and testing sets. The training set was used to train the model, while the testing set was used to assess its performance on unseen data.
2. **Model Training:** The SVC model was trained on the training data. During training, the model learned to identify patterns that differentiate spam and non-spam messages.
3. **Evaluation:** The model's performance was rigorously evaluated on the testing set using various metrics, including:
    - Accuracy: The proportion of messages correctly classified as spam or ham.

### Results

The SVC model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy value] in classifying SMS messages as spam or non-spam. Additionally, the model demonstrated high precision and recall values, indicating its efficacy in identifying both spam and legitimate messages. This performance highlights the model's potential for real-world applications.

### Future Work

The project can be further extended by:

* Exploring more sophisticated deep learning architectures that might potentially yield even better performance.
* Integrating the model into a real-world application, such as a spam filter for an SMS messaging platform.
* Experimenting with hyperparameter tuning of the SVC model to potentially optimize its accuracy and performance.

### Conclusion

This project successfully developed a machine learning model for SMS spam classification using Support Vector Machines. The SVC model achieved promising results and has the potential to be a valuable tool in combating spam messages.
